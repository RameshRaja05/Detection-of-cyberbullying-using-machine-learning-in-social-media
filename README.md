# Detection of Cyberbullying using Machine Learning in Social Media

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting cyberbullying in social media. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately identify instances of cyberbullying and help mitigate its negative impact.

## Introduction
Cyberbullying has become a significant issue in today's digital world. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to detect instances of cyberbullying in social media platforms. By building an effective model, we can identify and address cyberbullying promptly, thereby promoting a safer online environment.

## Features
- Role-based login system:
  - Admin Role: Provides access to evaluation metrics in graph format on the web page.
  - User Role: Access to a mini social media website interface where you can comment or tweet your response.
- Automatic detection of hateful and offensive words in comments or tweets.
- Warning prompts for hateful or offensive content.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RameshRaja05/Detection-of-cyberbullying-using-machine-learning-in-social-media.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (note if you can't find the requirements.txt file run the following command to generate a requirements.txt `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`  # Python3
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`  # Python2)
3. [Additional installation instructions, if any]

## Usage
1. Run the application: `python app.py`
2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`

### Admin Role
